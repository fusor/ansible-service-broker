# Ansible Service Broker
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/openshift/ansible-service-broker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/openshift/ansible-service-broker)

Ansible Service Broker is an implementation of the [Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker) that will manage applications defined by [Ansible Playbook Bundles](https://github.com/fusor/ansible-playbook-bundle).


An Ansible Playbook Bundle (APB) is a new method for defining and distributing container applications in OpenShift consisting of a bundle of Ansible Playbooks built into a container with an Ansible runtime.

Read more about the Ansible Service Broker and Ansible Playbook Bundles in this [introduction](docs/introduction.md).

**NOTE**: this broker will be based on the [open-service-broker-sdk](https://github.com/openshift/open-service-broker-sdk) project in the future.

## Prerequisites

[glide](https://glide.sh/) is used for dependency management. Binaries are available on the
[releases page](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide/releases).

**Packages**

Our dependencies currently require development headers for btrfs and dev-mapper.

CentOS/RHEL/Fedora (sub dnf for Fedora):

`sudo yum install device-mapper-devel btrfs-progs-devel etcd`

## Setup

```
sudo /sbin/service etcd restart # start etcd
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift
git clone https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker
make vendor
```

**Config**
A broker is configured via the `config.yaml` file. It's recommended to
copy over `etc/example-config.yaml` to `etc/ansible-service-broker/config.yaml`, and edit
as desired.

See the [Broker Configuration](docs/config.md) doc for other example
configurations.

## Targets
### Broker Targets
* `make vendor`: Installs or updates the dependencies
* `make build`: Builds the binary from source
* `make install`: Installs the built binary.
* `make run`: Runs the broker with the default profile, configured via `/etc/dev.config.yaml`
* `make uninstall` Deletes the installed binary and config.yaml
  * Notes for install, run, and uninstall:
    * The default install prefix is /usr/local. Use `make build && sudo make install` to build and install.
    * Alternatively you can alter the installation directory by using PREFIX, e.g if you don't want to install somewhere that requires escalated privileges. `make build && PREFIX=~ make install`

### Docker Development Build Targets
* `make build-image`: Builds a docker container of the current source

### Docker Release Build Targets
* `make release` Builds a docker container using the latest rpm from [Copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/g/ansible-service-broker/ansible-service-broker/)
* `make push` Push the built image

### Misc Targets
* `make clean`: Delete binaries built from source
* `make run`: Runs the broker with the default profile, configured via `/etc/config.yaml`
* `make install`: Builds the source and installs in `$GOPATH/bin`
* `make test`: Runs the test suite.
* `make vendor`: Updates the dependencies
* `make build`: Builds a docker container of the current source
* `make deploy`: Deploys the currently build container into your cluster
* `make test`: Runs the test suite.

**Note**

Scripts found in `/test` can act as manual Service Catalog requests until a larger
user scenario can be scripted.
