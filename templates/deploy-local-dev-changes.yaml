# Goal of this template is to create or update the required resources so we can
# run the broker locally yet have it behave as if it's running in the cluster.
# The required changes are:
# - Create a route for our etcd so we can communicate to it
# - Update the asb service/endpoint so it points to our locally running broker
#   Note the asb route will now use our updated service/endpoint to contact our local broker
#   so there is no change from Service Catalog perspective
