# Contributing

Make a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) (PR).

Upon successful review, someone will approve the PR in the review thread.
A reviewer with merge power may merge the PR with or without an approval from
someone else. Or they may wait a business day to get further feedback from other
reviewers.

## Major Features
The ansible-service-broker community uses a proposal process when introducing a
major feature in order to encourage collaboration and building the best solution.

Major features are things that take about 2 weeks of development and introduce
disruptive changes to the code base.

Start the proposal process by reviewing the [proposal template](docs/proposals/proposal-template.md).
Use this document to guide how to write a proposal. Then, submit it as a pull
request where the community will review the plan.  The proposal process will require
two approvals from the community before merging.
