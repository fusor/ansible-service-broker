13:36:17 <jmrodri> Anyone have any news they would like to share?
13:36:29 <ernelson> hi o/
13:36:46 <ernelson> I guess I do?
13:36:59 <jmrodri> ernelson: go for it
13:37:35 <ernelson> We've been working on operators for the automation broker and the template broker, both operators exist now. You might have noticed the apb directly moved to "ansible_role"
13:38:06 <ernelson> The ansible is being used for both APB deployments and operator deployments. There's an operator/ dir in ansible_role that has the operator specific stuff, and a make build-operator target now that will build the image
13:38:40 <jmrodri> that's awesome
13:38:42 <ernelson> additionally for catasb users, you can flip some switches and get a cluster with OLM and a catalog with these operators available. I'm still in the midst of figuring out the permissions, but if you're interested, ping me
13:39:16 <ernelson> </break>
13:39:30 <jmrodri> #info work has been done on operators for the automation broker and the template broker.

13:42:20 <jmrodri> dymurray: looks like you wrote this up. That does sound like a great feature.
13:42:53 <jmrodri> it would be very useful as I often want to run against ansibleplaybookbundle org and my own

13:45:04 <dymurray> issue 1097 seems like it would be nice to add too
13:45:09 <dymurray> Doesn't seem too hard
13:45:25 <jmrodri> dymurray: so the above seems doable?
13:45:34 <jmrodri> I can align it to the 4.0 release

13:46:12 <brokerbot> jmrodri: link
13:46:30 <jmrodri> dymurray: okay that's how I read it, but didn't know if that was a huge change or not
13:46:49 <jmrodri> ah this one looks like a simple docs change.
13:46:55 <jmrodri> I'll look into this one

13:47:58 <jmrodri> ernelson: another minishift issue. Is this new? or something that is known?
13:48:04 <ernelson> checking
13:48:18 <jmrodri> I swear seems like minishift is always broken for some reason. And we're always playing catchup
13:49:02 <dymurray> unsure... I saw some discussion yesterday on IRC that there was some issues
13:49:10 <dymurray> but Jason wasn't able to reproduce
13:49:30 <ernelson> yeah there are a lot of ways people get the broker into minishift, or try to
13:49:44 <ernelson> I'm not sure about that one, I'll see if I can reproduce and if not, I'll close that one jmrodri
13:49:58 <jmrodri> ernelson: okay. I'll assign it to you
