13:57:12 <dymurrayRH> jmrodri, yeah couldn't reproduce. Unsure what was causing #1037
13:57:49 <jmrodri> dymurrayRH: fair enough.
13:58:08 <jmrodri> I'll leave it open in case we get more information about the versions that were used.

14:01:21 <dymurrayRH> jmrodri, yes it is
14:01:29 <jmontleon> jmrodri, psql? if thats not postgresql no idea
14:01:30 <dymurrayRH> jmrodri, you can assign that to me if you want

14:01:40 <dymurrayRH> Don't think it will be very hard
14:02:02 <jmrodri> okay so probably not until next release of broker timeframe (1.4)
14:02:15 <jmrodri> jmontleon: hehe psql is postgresql :) that's my short hand.

14:03:58 <brokerbot> jmrodri: action
14:04:34 <jmontleon> jmrodri, not sure what he meant by that; is there an issue or bz somewhere?
14:05:23 <jmrodri> jmontleon: no, I sadly can't remember either. Clearly it wasn't super important since no one is clamouring about it being broker :)
14:05:26 <jmrodri> s/broker/broken

14:05:58 <jmrodri> does anyone have anything they'd like to discuss?
14:06:45 <jmontleon> i don't know if everyone saw friday night, but at present you can use catasb (at your own peril) to get a functioning 3.11 cluster
14:06:58 <jmrodri> that's awesome.
14:07:10 <jmrodri> I did hear about some wizardry you did.
