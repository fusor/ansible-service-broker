13:46:36 <brokerbot> jmrodri: topic
13:46:46 <jmrodri> there are no new bundle-lib issues open at this time.
13:46:49 <jmrodri> \o/
13:46:55 <jmrodri> #topic automation broker
13:46:55 <brokerbot> jmrodri: topic
13:47:18 <jmrodri> #info 2 new issues were created
13:47:18 <brokerbot> jmrodri: info
13:47:55 <jmrodri> #info Failed provision will automatically trigger continous deprovision
13:47:55 <brokerbot> jmrodri: info
13:48:01 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/issues/1010
13:48:01 <brokerbot> jmrodri: link
13:48:33 <jmrodri> so this issue states that if we fail during provision, the service-catalog triggers continuous deprovisions
13:49:05 <jmrodri> it's my understanding that the catalog will attempt to do orphan mitigation and try to deprovision the instance. If the deprovision fails, it will continue to try.
13:49:26 <ernelson> yeah that's expected catalog behavior
13:49:37 <dymurray> Even though it's expected.... its incredibly ugly
13:49:51 <dymurray> had an APB that failed and I had to go delete 28 namespaces
13:50:30 <ernelson> we probably want to explore ways to mitigate that on our side
13:50:48 <ernelson> if a deprovision has been failing with enough frequency, we stop trying
13:50:56 <jmrodri> I think shurley mentioned at some point we'll need a way to back off the requests after a certain number
13:51:02 <jmrodri> ernelson: yeah
13:51:04 <ernelson> for some period of time, or at least some strategy to not completely overwhelm
13:51:09 <jmrodri> a rate limiter is what shurley called it
13:51:51 <jmrodri> okay I'll leave this issue open, and add a comment that possibly a rate limiter with some sort of backoff or limited number of tries that we can configure might be useful.
13:52:01 <dzager> like a backoff?
13:52:18 <dzager> how do you tell the service-catalog, nah..I'm good ask later?
13:52:28 <ernelson> you don't, the catalog doesn't support that
13:52:39 <ernelson> but we can report failures without actually running the apb
13:52:44 <jmrodri> by back off I mean we accept the request but basically drop it on the floor
13:52:45 <dzager> just ignore them for some period of time?
13:53:18 <jmrodri> so say at first we act on them each time. then if we get say 10 back to back, we don't run the apb for at least 5 minutes.
13:53:26 <ernelson> it's still somewhat at odds with our default choice to keep failed namespaces around
13:53:49 <dzager> maybe remove that default?
13:53:52 <ernelson> because the user is still going to have to go in and manually clean those up, unless the broker also has some kind of cleanup strategy coupled with the backoff
13:53:56 <jmrodri> if we keep getting requests and it's been 5 minutes, we try again. if that fails, we increase the time. Until we hit a configured time where we stop trying altogheter and just return failed
13:54:34 <ernelson> well, if you're someone who has a broken deprovision, you probably need those around to debug
13:54:35 <jmrodri> dzager: yep, we could also add a feature to reap those namespaces right?
13:54:46 <jmrodri> ernelson: yeah for debugging
13:54:47 <ernelson> but it's also obnoxious that there are a ton of them to manually clean
13:54:49 <dwhatley> we could remove each namespace except for the final one that fails
13:55:06 <jmrodri> dwhatley: that's a good option
13:55:21 <ernelson> +1, could be an additional configuration cleanup "mode"
13:55:26 <dymurray> yeah I would like that
13:55:28 <dymurray> +1
13:55:46 <jmrodri> so the take away for this issue is 1) looking to adding some sort of rate limiter 2) consider a mechanism to handle left around namespaces from failed actions
13:56:14 <jmrodri> #action jmrodri add notes from this irc discussion to issue 1010 https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/issues/1010
13:56:14 <brokerbot> jmrodri: action
13:56:26 <jmrodri> okay moving on to the next one
13:56:34 <jmrodri> #info Multiline secrets are not correctly parsed
13:56:34 <brokerbot> jmrodri: info
13:56:40 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/issues/1028
13:56:40 <brokerbot> jmrodri: link
13:57:10 <jmrodri> basically this one states the user created a multiline secret and we don't parse it correctly.
13:57:21 <jmrodri> as if we are using newline as the delimiter
13:57:30 <jmrodri> I have not verified this.
13:57:39 <jmontleon> can i get an ack please: https://github.com/fusor/catasb/pull/253/files
13:57:55 <jmrodri> jmontleon: done
13:58:02 <jmontleon> thanks jmrodri
13:58:08 <jmrodri> anyone want to volunteer for issue 1028?

13:59:49 <jmrodri> 3 of them assigned to me and related to bindings, I'm hoping to get those done this week while I investigate another binding issue
14:00:15 <jmrodri> the 4th one is ernelson issue 974. We just need to determine if that's something that will be fixed in this release or not.
14:00:25 <jmrodri> #action ernelson get an answer on issue 974

14:00:52 <darkmagic> Christel just posted this "denial" on the freenode blog https://freenode.net/news/spam-shake Why does this blog post mention "10.2 million" THREE times?
14:01:57 <jmrodri> wow spam bots STILL going on
14:02:14 <jmrodri> okay that's it for the issues
14:02:21 <jmrodri> No features topic

14:02:41 <jmrodri> #info consider making this IRC meeting bi-weekly or monthly
14:02:41 <brokerbot> jmrodri: info
14:03:12 <jmrodri> right now this IRC meeting is scheduled weekly. I think that's too often and we're not getting a good set of topics to discuss
14:03:36 <jmrodri> I was thinking of moving the meeting to bi-weekly (every 2 weeks, aka twice a month)
14:03:43 <jmrodri> roughly twice a month
14:03:50 <jmrodri> anyone object to that?
14:04:00 <ernelson> sounds good to me
14:04:01 * jmrodri thinks I'm having the meeting by myself this week :)
14:04:02 <dymurray> +1
14:04:08 <matzew> hi, I try the OKD 3.10 install, but getting -> "error: update acceptor rejected openshift-automation-service-broker-1: pods for rc 'openshift-automation-service-broker/openshift-automation-service-broker-1' took longer than 600 seconds to become available
14:04:10 <matzew> "
14:04:40 <jmrodri> ernelson: dymurray okay I'm going to do bi-weekly to start.
14:04:56 <jmrodri> #action jmrodri update meeting invite to be bi-weekly, send out email to asb list to announce it
14:04:56 <brokerbot> jmrodri: action
14:05:05 <jmrodri> #action jmrodri send out meeting minutes for today
