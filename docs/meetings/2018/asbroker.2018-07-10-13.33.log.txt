13:33:50 <fabianvf> Hi
13:34:39 <jmrodri> hello everyone. Glad to see everyone.

13:35:03 <jmrodri> #info bundle-lib 0.2.4 release to happen today (pending a couple PRs)
13:35:03 <brokerbot> jmrodri: info
13:35:30 <jmrodri> we plan on doing a bundle-lib release today. THere are a couple PRs outstanding that we will merge before doing the release.
13:35:57 <jmrodri> #info apb 2.0.0 alpha? release tomorrow (deprecating python tool -> golang). Working to make it available in Copr
13:35:57 <brokerbot> jmrodri: info
13:36:03 <jmrodri> dymurray: is this yours?
13:36:14 <dymurray> jmrodri, yes. Should have an RPM available on Copr today
13:36:23 <dymurray> its the new apb CLI tool written in go
13:36:24 <jmrodri> excellent
13:36:31 <jmrodri> \o/
13:36:49 <dymurray> Definitely invite everyone to check it out :)
13:36:50 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/automationbroker/apb
13:36:50 <brokerbot> jmrodri: link
13:36:56 <jmrodri> adding a link to the new repo
13:37:14 <jmrodri> dymurray: so this will replace the current python apb tool, correct?
13:37:53 <dymurray> jmrodri, yes. A dnf upgrade of the apb package will erase the python components and install the go binary. Some commands have been deprecated or slgihtly modified but it should spit out what to do if you type an old command
13:38:11 <jmrodri> awesome! great work. looking forward to it.
13:38:20 <jmrodri> any other news items folks would like to share?
13:38:51 <jmrodri> #info OSB F2F and service-catalog F2F happening this week in Sunnyvale, CA
13:38:51 <brokerbot> jmrodri: info
13:39:07 <jmrodri> I believe if you are on any of those calls they'll have an agenda and a dialin.
13:39:26 <jmrodri> THe OSB weekly call is canceled this week
13:39:37 <jmrodri> moving on to previous actions
13:39:43 <jmrodri> #topic review previous actions

13:40:27 <jmrodri> ernelson: this is assigned to you, not sure if you have the cycles for it. Might need someone to retest this.
13:40:54 <jmrodri> hrm is this minishift related or something different? or is that just a coincidence
13:40:59 <ernelson> jmrodri: Basically had some time free up with the catalog work done and waiting for it to hit origin, so I'll look into this
13:41:06 <ernelson> I need to update the minishift addon as well to use the APB
13:41:11 <jmrodri> ernelson: okay thanks

13:41:36 <brokerbot> jmrodri: link
13:41:50 <jmrodri> this is assigned to me, I looked into this last week.
13:42:11 <jmrodri> we have 9 calls to panic(..) , 5 are from clients
13:42:44 <jmrodri> the panic lives inside the once.FOO.Do() call
13:42:55 <jmrodri> func Kubernetes() (*KubernetesClient, error) {
13:42:55 <jmrodri> once.Kubernetes.Do(func() {
13:42:55 <jmrodri> client, err := newKubernetes()
13:42:55 <jmrodri> if err != nil {
13:42:55 <jmrodri> log.Error(err.Error())
13:42:57 <jmrodri> panic(err.Error())
13:43:00 <jmrodri> }
13:43:03 <jmrodri> instances.Kubernetes = client
13:43:05 <jmrodri> })
13:43:13 <jmrodri> actually let's put this in the discussion section
13:43:27 <shurley> Yeah, I thik we may need to do a recover function and then return an error
13:43:30 <jmrodri> the status of it right now is I've investigated but not sure how to move forward.
13:43:39 <jmrodri> shurley: let's move that to the discussion

13:54:49 <jmrodri> we'll have to go through that to see what will get moved and what will get punted.
13:54:57 <shurley> should be move this to the discussion. I donâ€™t know where the shared services stuff is at
13:55:12 <jmrodri> shurley: sure

13:56:59 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/automationbroker/bundle-lib/issues/120
13:56:59 <brokerbot> jmrodri: link

13:58:21 <jmrodri> I don't see any that are huge blockers at the moment.
13:58:35 <shurley> Hey why are we doing that?
13:58:50 <jmrodri> that deletion thing?
13:58:58 <shurley> kubernetes objects have a marked for deletion flag already in the metadata section
13:59:10 <jmrodri> shurley: if so then we can use that.
13:59:39 <jmrodri> it will most likely change his other PR when it gets posted.
13:59:44 <jmrodri> shurley: thanks for that
13:59:46 <shurley> https://godoc.org/k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1#ObjectMeta
14:00:23 <jmrodri> shurley: I added that to the issue
14:00:26 <jmrodri> thanks
14:01:38 <jmrodri> okay not a lot of movement on issues right now in terms of new ones coming in. That's good I guess, everything must be working :)
14:01:41 <jmrodri> hehe
14:02:03 <jmrodri> anyone have any features they need to discuss today?
14:02:10 <jmrodri> #topic features
14:02:10 <brokerbot> jmrodri: topic
14:02:35 <jmrodri> if not, we can go straight to the open discussion piece of the meeting.
14:02:56 <shurley> maleck13: philipgough wondering how multi tenant stuff is going
14:04:06 <philipgough> Hey shurley, maleck13 is afk as far as I can see. Still progressing some spikes around that currently. maleck13 would be able to give you more insight into overall progress
14:04:36 <shurley> ok thanks!
14:05:13 <jmrodri> awesome
14:05:21 <philipgough> shurley: It is in hand and still ongoing with PoC's, that is as much as I can give you :)
14:05:38 <jmrodri> thanks philipgough
14:06:01 <jmrodri> any other questions or information about features anyone wants to share at the moment?
14:06:22 <philipgough> Just on the topic of the conditional params feature we had bee working on
14:06:31 <jmrodri> okay
14:06:39 <philipgough> I guess we can progress that and fix the build when bundle-lib is released
14:06:59 <philipgough> So we will be keen to see that one out asap at that point
14:07:57 <jmrodri> yes, looks like the supporting PR for that was merged. And the release will be done today.
14:08:04 <philipgough> I'll update that dep and progress that, hoping to land it by end of sprint, next wednesday as I am moving teams in red hat
14:08:29 <philipgough> jmrodri: Yep cool, thats what I assumed, just clarifying where we are at with that re deadlines
14:09:13 <shurley> Yeah we actually need it in by tomorrow
14:09:28 <shurley> I think we have a feature freeze for our code. So we need to get this in
14:09:34 <jmrodri> +1
14:09:42 <philipgough> shurley: Ok thats good to know then. Great
14:09:52 <philipgough> ping maleck13 ^^
14:10:05 <philipgough> Thanks shurley
14:11:10 <jmrodri> okay moving onto the open discussions
14:11:14 <jmrodri> #topic open discussion
14:11:14 <brokerbot> jmrodri: topic
14:11:24 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/automationbroker/bundle-lib/issues/94
14:11:24 <brokerbot> jmrodri: link
14:11:30 <jmrodri> okay this is the panic story
14:11:54 <jmrodri> so like I posted earlier 5 of the 9 are in clients with a paradigm that looks like this
14:11:57 <jmrodri> func Kubernetes() (*KubernetesClient, error) {
14:12:00 <jmrodri> once.Kubernetes.Do(func() {
14:12:02 <jmrodri> client, err := newKubernetes()
14:12:05 <jmrodri> if err != nil {
14:12:07 <jmrodri> log.Error(err.Error())
14:12:10 <jmrodri> panic(err.Error())
14:12:12 <jmrodri> }
14:12:15 <jmrodri> instances.Kubernetes = client
14:12:17 <jmrodri> })
14:12:20 <jmrodri> if instances.Kubernetes == nil {
14:12:22 <jmrodri> return nil, errors.New("Kubernetes client instance is nil")
14:12:25 <jmrodri> }
14:12:27 <jmrodri> return instances.Kubernetes, nil
14:12:30 <jmrodri> }
14:12:32 <jmrodri> I wanted to make this return an error but then realized once.XXX.Do() does not return an error :)
14:12:37 <jmrodri> the other 4 panic uses are different
14:13:00 <jmrodri> they occur in the NewRuntime() method
14:13:37 <jmrodri> https://github.com/automationbroker/bundle-lib/blob/master/runtime/runtime.go#L102-L127
14:13:37 <shurley> I think that, we should use a recover function
14:13:49 <shurley> and have that return the error
14:13:49 <jmrodri> for all of them?
14:14:51 <shurley> Oh wait that might not work the way I want it too
14:14:53 <jmrodri> but recover docs state
14:14:55 <jmrodri> Recover is a built-in function that regains control of a panicking goroutine. Recover is only useful inside deferred functions. During normal execution, a call to recover will return nil and have no other effect. If the current goroutine is panicking, a call to recover will capture the value given to panic and resume normal execution.
14:15:38 <jmrodri> so part of me says if I'm using this library and I use it wrong I'd like for it to panic LOUDLY
14:16:05 <jmrodri> so for example NewRuntime, if that fails "we're done I'm out"
14:16:32 <jmrodri> but I can also see that if I was the use of this library I'd like to know this was failing and try to handle it. Maybe I need more user interaction etc
14:17:22 <shurley> Yeah, I think it makes sense to return an error and have the caller deal with if it should panic or not
14:17:36 <shurley> > For a real-world example of panic and recover, see the json package from the Go standard library. It decodes JSON-encoded data with a set of recursive functions. When malformed JSON is encountered, the parser calls panic to unwind the stack to the top-level function call, which recovers from the panic and returns an appropriate error value (see the 'error' and 'unmarshal' methods of the decodeState type in decode.go).
14:17:48 <shurley> from the recover docs
14:18:15 <jmrodri> oh I see that
14:18:29 <ernelson> shurley: +1
14:18:50 <jmrodri> shurley: okay so for NewRuntime, we should make it return error. Then for the clients panic and recover?
14:18:53 <jmrodri> is that what I'm hearing?
14:18:59 <jmrodri> s/hearing/reading
14:19:19 <jmrodri> (though with all the clicky keyboards in here, I guess I am hearing the words as they are typed) :D
14:19:28 <jmrodri> #longlivetheclick
14:19:28 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "longlivetheclick" is not a valid command.
14:19:38 <ernelson> we make a lot of noise in this corner
14:20:03 <jmrodri> and light, sensory overload.
14:20:10 <shurley> jmrodri: +1 that makes sense to me
14:20:12 * jmrodri puts on subglasses and headphones :)
14:20:32 <jmrodri> shurley: okay I can look going down that path. It won't be in today's release though
14:22:25 <shurley> no worries from me
14:23:28 * ernelson wonders what are "subglasses"
14:23:33 <ernelson> :)
14:24:04 <jmrodri> ernelson: that's when you have a cold in the summer
14:24:19 <jmrodri> shurley: summarized in the issue: https://github.com/automationbroker/bundle-lib/issues/94#issuecomment-403841080
14:24:44 <shurley> +_1
14:24:47 <jmrodri> okay that's all I had on this topic
14:24:55 <jmrodri> anyone else have anything they'd like to discuss?
14:24:59 <jmrodri> comments? questions?
14:25:05 <jmrodri> we have 6 minutes left
14:25:33 <shurley> none from me thansk jmrodri !
14:25:49 <jmrodri> if not, then we can end a little early.
