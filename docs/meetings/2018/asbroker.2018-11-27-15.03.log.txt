15:08:26 <jmrodri> Looks like we have 4 new issues in the broker
15:08:37 <jmrodri> #info need apiVersion 2 of ansible servcie broker

15:09:00 <jmrodri> Looks like we have a user trying to use the broker with Cloud Foundry.
15:09:30 <jmrodri> From what I've read in the issue it seems related to authentication between Cloud Foundry and the broker.
15:10:25 <jmrodri> I've added a comment for the user on how to configure basic auth to use with Cloud Foundry as it seems the broker is running in OpenShift and just being controlled by Cloud Foundry

15:17:26 <jmrodri> I think we should cancel these IRC meetings. The attendance has dropped to nil and I'm not sure anyone is getting anything out of it.
15:17:41 <jmrodri> I will send an email to ansible-service-broker list to start the discussion.
