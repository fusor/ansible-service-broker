13:31:14 <fabianvf> Hello
13:31:17 <jmrodri> sorry about the errors, forgot to fix that :( should be okay though.
13:31:20 <jmrodri> o/
13:31:39 <ernelson> Morning
13:31:53 <shurley> morning
13:32:10 <dymurray> Good morning
13:32:34 <dzager> morning
13:32:41 <jmrodri> okay keep raising your hand as you join. Thanks.
13:32:51 <jmrodri> #topic News
13:32:51 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "topic" is not a valid command.
13:33:00 <jmrodri> anyone have any news they'd like to share?
13:33:16 <jmrodri> Doesn't look like anything in the agenda right now.
13:34:18 <shurley> I guess we can share that master for ASB is open for new features?
13:34:29 <jmrodri> shurley: that's a good one.
13:34:35 <shurley> but donâ€™t remember if it was open last week or not
13:35:01 <jmrodri> I think late last week we did the branch.
13:35:11 <jmrodri> #info ASB master is open for new features
13:35:11 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "info" is not a valid command.
13:35:39 <jmrodri> Okay, that's it for news I think.
13:35:46 <jmrodri> #topic bug/issue triage
13:35:46 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "topic" is not a valid command.
13:36:09 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%223.10+%7C+release-1.2%22
13:36:09 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "link" is not a valid command.
13:36:21 <jmrodri> a bunch of release-1.2 issues
13:36:49 <jmrodri> someone stated "Think we should either close or re-align these bugs.
13:36:51 <jmrodri> "
13:36:55 <jmrodri> shurley: was that you?
13:37:19 <shurley> I thought that we need to move these to 3.11 or 3.12
13:37:22 <shurley> or close them
13:37:26 <jmrodri> okay
13:37:35 <jmrodri> #info Binding errors are no longer displayed
13:37:35 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "info" is not a valid command.
13:37:37 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/issues/941
13:37:37 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "link" is not a valid command.
13:37:40 <shurley> but 3.10 is pretty much closed right?
13:37:49 <jmrodri> yes
13:38:04 <ernelson> are bzs frozen as well?
13:38:37 <jmrodri> ernelson: I think there's a few more days for BZs. So if we deem these need fixing then we need to do them ASAP
13:38:46 <jmrodri> otherwise, what shurley said makes sense, move or close
13:39:09 <ernelson> ack
13:39:17 <mhrivnak> The features seem like a no-brainer to re-align at this point.
13:39:18 <shurley> re: 941 I have not reproduced it has any one?
13:39:54 <jmrodri> I haven't actually tried. At least I didn't pay attention to this when I did binds recently. I'll test it today, if I can't recreate I will close.
13:40:11 <jmrodri> #action jmrodri take Issue 941, test, fix and or close
13:40:11 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "action" is not a valid command.
13:40:12 <ernelson> seems like it could potentially be a console thing?
13:40:22 <ernelson> haven't tried to repro though
13:40:31 <jmrodri> ernelson: possibly. if it is, I will create a bug against console
13:40:48 <shurley> ernelson: I was thinking that the tag was old and it probably has been fixed in a later version
13:41:01 <jmrodri> okay moving on to the next issue.
13:41:10 <jmrodri> #info Consider a configuration switch that will execute APBs in ansible verbose mode for debugging purposes
13:41:10 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "info" is not a valid command.
13:41:16 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/issues/822
13:41:16 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "link" is not a valid command.
13:41:33 <jmrodri> I think tis is useful but not for 3.10
13:41:42 <jmrodri> 3.12?
13:41:47 <jmrodri> I doubt we'll do this in 3.11
13:42:02 <shurley> +1 to either
13:42:35 <ernelson> +1
13:42:36 <jmrodri> done
13:42:51 <jmrodri> #info ClusterServiceBroker "ansible-service-broker" - Status: 400 -> Description: not found; ResponseError

13:42:55 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "link" is not a valid command.
13:43:33 <ernelson> ping
13:43:37 <ernelson> doh, sorry, wrong window
13:44:06 <jmrodri> is this something we need to fix for 3.10? or can it wait until 3.11? I have not attempted to test this out.
13:44:12 <jmrodri> We need an assignee
13:44:16 <jmrodri> any volunteers?
13:45:05 <jmrodri> is this only an issue with 3.7? or does it also exist in 3.10?
13:45:08 <shurley> Oh I think this is a provision during bootstrap
13:45:31 <shurley> I think 3.11 we have other things tracking this as well though
13:45:53 <shurley> and we have an issue tracking the bad error messages in bundle lib
13:45:53 <jmrodri> shurley: can I assign it to you and you either close as a duplicate etc?
13:46:00 <shurley> sure
13:46:59 <jmrodri> #action shurley to shepherd issue 813
13:46:59 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "action" is not a valid command.
13:47:15 <jmrodri> #info Discussion: Broker should not fail hard when registry names collide
13:47:15 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "info" is not a valid command.
13:47:22 <jmrodri> #linkhttps://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/issues/753

13:47:29 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "link" is not a valid command.
13:47:54 <jmrodri> I say punt to 3.11
13:48:04 <shurley> I think right now we need the name
13:48:26 <shurley> to gurantee uniqueness in the external name and the hash
13:48:35 <jmrodri> should we close it then?
13:48:35 <shurley> (Id) for the service catalog
13:49:03 <shurley> My opinion has been I would rather yell about it then do some funky logic behind the scenes
13:49:41 <shurley> I think this does warrent a small discussion about that point though and was opening we coudl just get that out of the way really fast?
13:49:42 <jmrodri> I prefer fail loudly too
13:50:35 <jmrodri> shurley: want to discuss it in the open discussion later in the meeting?
13:50:54 <jmrodri> let's do that, we have 5 minutes left in triage
13:50:59 <mhrivnak> +1 defer
13:51:26 <jmrodri> #info Should consider using pkg/errors
13:51:26 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "info" is not a valid command.
13:51:33 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/issues/717
13:51:33 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "link" is not a valid command.
13:51:50 <jmrodri> definitely move out of release-1.2
13:52:00 <jmrodri> I don't think we're doing tis in 1.3 (3.11) either.
13:52:13 <mhrivnak> +!
13:52:16 <mhrivnak> er +1
13:52:36 <jmrodri> it's one of those things that would be nice but we're not broken enough to fix, unless someone gets bored
13:52:38 <ernelson> there are some really particular rules around the names in the catalog fyi
13:53:03 <ernelson> i don't recall all of them off my head but it's an ugly bit of logic (it's been my pleasure of dealing with that lately :))
13:53:18 <jmrodri> ernelson: wrt errors?
13:53:38 <ernelson> oh sorry, I may have misread an earlier comment about uniqueness
13:53:48 <ernelson> some are immutable some are not, some can be set *sometimes*
13:54:20 <jmrodri> ernelson: okay, yeah we'll discuss that later in the meeting. So bring these comments then.
13:54:30 <ernelson> ack
13:54:36 <jmrodri> okay I moved Issue 717 to release-1.4 (3.12)
13:54:52 <jmrodri> #info BindInstance.Parameters use unclear
13:54:52 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "info" is not a valid command.
13:54:58 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/issues/692
13:54:58 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "link" is not a valid command.
13:55:07 <jmrodri> mhrivnak: this was one you opened
13:55:14 <jmrodri> I think this is still a valid issue
13:55:23 <jmrodri> the question is when should we fix it?
13:55:31 <mhrivnak> I'm ok closing this on the assumption that it'll get addressed in a broader contract re-think. There's not a user-facing problem right now.
13:55:38 <mhrivnak> I'm also ok keeping it open.
13:55:44 <shurley> I think this is related to a complete change in how parameters are handled througout IMO
13:55:53 <mhrivnak> but more as technical debt now than bug.
13:56:00 <mhrivnak> agreed.
13:56:08 <shurley> its user facing because of bundle lib now IMO
13:56:24 <mhrivnak> developer-facing maybe?
13:56:29 <jmrodri> shall I remove the release then and just leave it open?
13:56:42 <mhrivnak> That works for me.
13:56:42 <jmrodri> is there anything tracking the broader contract right now?
13:57:03 <mhrivnak> I don't know of an issue tracking it. Maybe there's something in trello?
13:57:23 <jmrodri> mhrivnak: can I assign this to you then, to either link to a trello, close, etc.?
13:58:07 <jmrodri> #action mhrivnak link issue 692 to an existing trello or close
13:58:07 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "action" is not a valid command.
13:58:21 <mhrivnak> Sure thing.
13:58:24 <jmrodri> I removed the release-1.2 flag
13:59:14 <jmrodri> so we're out of time for bug triage. Do we want to extend it or move on to the features and discussion sections (these are longer)
14:00:18 <jmrodri> okay let's move on
14:00:21 <mhrivnak> There's only one more bug in your list.
14:00:35 <mhrivnak> I'm happy either way.
14:00:52 <jmrodri> I see 6 others :)
14:00:58 <jmrodri> https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%223.10+%7C+release-1.2%22
14:01:05 <jmrodri> first 3 we already covered
14:01:07 <mhrivnak> Mostly features.
14:01:11 <jmrodri> OH
14:01:16 <jmrodri> I see
14:01:26 <jmrodri> okay let's knock out the bug
14:01:32 <jmrodri> mhrivnak: thanks for pointing that out
14:01:47 <jmrodri> #action jmrodri move 3.10 aligned features to 3.11 or 3.12
14:01:47 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "action" is not a valid command.
14:02:00 <jmrodri> #info Unable to deploy an APB with privileged security context
14:02:00 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "info" is not a valid command.
14:02:07 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/openshift/ansible-service-broker/issues/351
14:02:07 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "link" is not a valid command.
14:02:36 <jmrodri> dymurray: this one was yours.
14:02:45 <jmrodri> is this still a problem?
14:03:05 <jmrodri> okay last comment from March stated: still a valid issue
14:03:10 <dymurray> jmrodri, yeah we need the ability to declare what permissions an APB needs up front. We still don't have a solution for this
14:03:28 <jmrodri> so is this more of a feature than a bug?
14:03:41 <dymurray> jmrodri, yeah a feature sounds good
14:03:50 <jmrodri> feels like both. It's a deficiency but not really easy to fix.
14:04:07 <jmrodri> Okay, marking as a feature for now. I'll take care of re-aligning.
14:04:07 <jmontleon> default
14:04:17 <mhrivnak> It's a use case we don't cover yet, so that seems ok as a feature.
14:04:54 <jmrodri> cool
14:04:59 <jmrodri> #topic Features
14:04:59 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "topic" is not a valid command.
14:05:30 <jmrodri> #info rom @maleck13 This now tries to call out to OpenShift to figure out what type of cluster / platform it is running in. â€¦ I thought the caller of bundle should be in a position to know / specify where they are running rather than the lib deciding and would mean we could remove the callout in the NewRuntime method?
14:05:30 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "info" is not a valid command.
14:05:47 <jmrodri> I don't see maleck13 on right now
14:06:26 <jmrodri> is that related to the issue against asb module?
14:06:33 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/ansible-asb-modules/issues/19
14:06:33 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "link" is not a valid command.
14:07:59 <jmrodri> #action jmrodri review PR 96 on bundle-lib
14:07:59 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "action" is not a valid command.
14:08:12 <shurley> its from bundle lib
14:08:55 <shurley> basically bundle lib determines what cluster you are in/pointing to and will create a specific runtime for that
14:09:31 <shurley> he makes a good point which is the caller of bundle lib should probably say what type of cluster they are targeting and bundle lib should respect that
14:09:43 <shurley> but I am wanted to bring it up here
14:10:38 <mhrivnak> Is bundle-lib detecting it incorrectly sometimes? Or what's the problem with the current behavior?
14:10:39 <jmrodri> That seems logical, though it is nic the bundle-lib does it for me :)
14:10:53 <jmrodri> it's one less thing I have to worry about
14:11:00 <jmrodri> mhrivnak: good question
14:11:51 <shurley> its the seperation of concerns that is the question
14:12:45 <mhrivnak> So perhaps it makes sense to move the detection logic somewhere else?
14:13:47 <mhrivnak> In any case, to move this forward, it seems like we need more detail on the current situation and what changes are desired. Do we need to file an issue to track it?
14:14:13 <shurley> what more info do we need?
14:15:39 <mhrivnak> If it's an issue of separation of concerns, it would help to identify the individual concerns and show specifically where they co-mingle.
14:16:18 <mhrivnak> Granted, all I know about this issue is what's in this irc session. :)
14:16:27 <jmrodri> I could see being able to pass in the cluster I'm using, but if it isn't present the library could still figure it out
14:17:14 <jmrodri> I don't want to make it such that I always have to pass in the cluster I'm using to the library. Right now we pass in Configuration to the NewRuntime()
14:18:27 <jmrodri> okay we only have 3 minutes left in this section, and there looks to be another issue with the asb module
14:18:28 <dymurray> jmrodri, +1 I like that approach
14:19:22 <jmrodri> #info asb_last_operation fails without special permissions
14:19:22 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "info" is not a valid command.
14:19:24 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/ansible-asb-modules/issues/19
14:19:24 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "link" is not a valid command.
14:19:41 <jmrodri> so I wrote this up because we hit an odd situation working with sbcli
14:20:07 <jmrodri> some of the apbs use the asb_last_operation module and I witnessed an error from the logs:
14:20:19 <dymurray> Yeah we had to do this crappy solution :) https://github.com/automationbroker/sbcli/blob/master/cmd/exec.go#L225
14:20:40 <dymurray> hardcoded "in_cluster=false" for every provision
14:21:00 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/ansibleplaybookbundle/ansible-asb-modules/issues/19#issuecomment-391754631
14:21:00 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "link" is not a valid command.
14:21:04 <jmrodri> that was the error I got
14:21:43 <jmrodri> I think maleck13 wondered if we gave it the appropriate permissions
14:21:47 <jmrodri> I honestly don't remember
14:21:57 <shurley> so, is this a problem because the service account is not granted access to the pods?
14:21:59 <jmrodri> dymurray: we did create a role right?
14:22:14 <dymurray> shurley, jmrodri yeah I create an admin rolebinding for the namespace
14:22:18 <dymurray> so I actually expected it to work
14:22:18 <shurley> that feels like the bug is in sbcli for not setting the right permissions?
14:22:32 <dymurray> shurley, no I follow the exact same sandbox that we create with the broker
14:22:49 <shurley> where?
14:22:50 <dymurray> and thats documented in our docs for `oc run`ing an APB
14:23:04 <dymurray> shurley, https://github.com/automationbroker/sbcli/blob/master/setup_namespace.sh
14:23:08 <dymurray> we run this script first
14:23:13 <dymurray> and we use the `apb` service account when launching
14:24:03 <shurley> I think we need to figure that out first
14:24:16 <shurley> I think it is two issues
14:24:58 <dzager> the issue is that online is origin 3.9 right?
14:25:03 <shurley> I think we need to add a way to not update the last operation that is nicer than a hardcoded param/. I think that goes back to we need to rethink that whole workflow
14:25:15 <dymurray> dzager, happens in a local cluster as well I'm pretty sure
14:25:50 <shurley> and 2. sbcli should be granting the correct permissions to the namespace (and it should be role-binding because clusterrolebinding wont work in certain situations I think
14:26:20 <shurley> ob it is a rolebinding nvm sorry
14:26:24 <dymurray> shurley, I agree with 1. For point 2 yeah I think I'm doing it right
14:26:26 <shurley> getting confused
14:26:38 <dzager> if you look dymurray https://travis-ci.org/ansibleplaybookbundle/hello-world-apb/builds/365688174 I was able to get that module to reliably fail on openshift 3.9
14:27:20 <dymurray> dzager, okay so maybe it is something that's been resolved from 3.9->3.10 I can play around with it and update the issue
14:27:26 <dymurray> thanks shurley dzager
14:28:09 <jmrodri> #action dymurray play around with the module and update the issue
14:28:09 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "action" is not a valid command.
14:28:20 <jmrodri> So we only only hvae 2 minutes left.
14:28:43 <jmrodri> There are 2 open discussion items. Is that enough time to tackle one right now? or do we save those to talk about next week?
14:29:03 <jmrodri> #info add errcheck support
14:29:03 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "info" is not a valid command.
14:29:13 <jmrodri> #link https://github.com/automationbroker/bundle-lib/pull/95/files
14:29:13 <brokerbot> jmrodri: Error: "link" is not a valid command.
14:29:20 <jmrodri> shurley: does that just need review?
14:30:02 <shurley> Oh wanted to discuss it
14:30:26 <shurley> donâ€™t know if i like it, if it is going to not allow us to ignore errors when it makes sense
14:30:34 <shurley> i.e when we defer actions
14:31:24 <jmrodri> hrm I didn't realize the code had to change to allow for this 'errcheck'
14:31:30 <jmrodri> I thouguth it was just a tool you ran
14:31:35 <jmrodri> thought*
14:31:50 <shurley> got to run
14:31:54 <shurley> standup
14:32:05 <jmrodri> shurley: just add your comments to the PR review
14:32:13 <jmrodri> #endmeeting
