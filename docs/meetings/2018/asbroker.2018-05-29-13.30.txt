* Features  (jmrodri, 14:04:59)
  * rom @maleck13 This now tries to call out to OpenShift to figure out
    what type of cluster / platform it is running in. â€¦ I thought the
    caller of bundle should be in a position to know / specify where
    they are running rather than the lib deciding and would mean we
    could remove the callout in the NewRuntime method?  (jmrodri,
