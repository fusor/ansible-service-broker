* discussed the parameters work

* Our ansibleapp tooling will create label with base64 encoded data

  do 'linking'. They could be things that change the behavior of the
  application.

* Include types for answers, and anything else we learned from the nulecule work

  * the output of one bind could be the input into another ansibleapp as vars

  * need to be careful any parameters passed could be visible to all things in
    the cluster. Might be an opportunity to use kubernetes secrets
